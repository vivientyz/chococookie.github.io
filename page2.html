<h3>Bird Watching</h3>
<h4><p>The structures here are bird-watching hides madeout of twigs and branches. A bird hide allows youto camouflage yourself so that you can observewildlife, especially birds, at close proximity withoutalarming the creatures with your presence.With the large variety of birds in this park – 75different recorded species – for you to observe anddiscover, a bird hide is the best place to be in. Lookout for the Purple Heron (Ardea purpurea), the tallestbird seen in this park. It can grow up to 1m in height.</p>

<h3>Eco-toilet</h3>
<h4><p>The eco-toilet is the first of its kind in Singapore’spublic parks. It is a waterless, chemical-free systemthat converts human waste using bacteria and woodshavings into compost. Do not worry; this eco-toiletis odour-free as it has a good ventilation system.Biodegradable cleaning agents are used to keep thetoilet clean and hygienic too.Apart from being able to conserve water andconvert waste into fertiliser, this water-sensitiveurban design is also cheaper to build as comparedto a conventional toilet.</p>

<h3>Fresh water habitat</h3>
<h4><p>Begin your journey at the shelter near the mainentrance of the park. Stretching for 1.2km, theDiversity Trail offers an easy walk with views ofdifferent flora and fauna along the way. Here, youwill find dense woods flanking both sides of the trailwith tall trees towering over you.Take a short walk down the unique, soft footpathcarpeted with Manila Grass (Zoysia matrella) untilyou find the viewing platform from which youcan get a good look at the freshwater pond. Atfirst sight, the pond seems to be devoid of life, butas you move forward to take a closer look, youwill be amazed by the sheer number of life formsliving in and around the pond. The ideal habitatfor dragonflies, the pond attracts species like theCommon Parasol (Neurothemis fluctuans) and theBlue Dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis).</p>
