	<h3>More about Tampines Eco Green</h3>
	<p><h4>Tucked away in the Tampines heartland is Tampines Eco Green, a 36.5-hectare ecological parkthat resembles a savannah with marshlands, secondary forests and freshwater ponds. The greensanctuary is home to over 75 species of birds, 20 species of dragonflies, 35 species of butterfliesand 32 species of spiders. To minimise disturbance to the sensitive wildlife in the park, the area isnot lit at night.This ecologically conscious park includes features like an eco-toilet, vegetated swales, bird hidesand green roofs on all the shelters. Even the park furniture was made using recycled materialsand environmentally friendly products.The park offers three trails, namely Diversity Trail, Forest Trail and Marsh Trail, that weave throughthe secondary forests. Along those trails, nature lovers and wildlife photographers encounternature at close proximity inside bird hides while visitors walk or exercise on the green, easy terrain.

<h3>Bird Watching</h3>
<h4><p>The structures here are bird-watching hides madeout of twigs and branches. A bird hide allows youto camouflage yourself so that you can observewildlife, especially birds, at close proximity withoutalarming the creatures with your presence.With the large variety of birds in this park – 75different recorded species – for you to observe anddiscover, a bird hide is the best place to be in. Lookout for the Purple Heron (Ardea purpurea), the tallestbird seen in this park. It can grow up to 1m in height.</p></h4>

<h3>Eco-toilet</h3>
<h4><p>The eco-toilet is the first of its kind in Singapore’spublic parks. It is a waterless, chemical-free systemthat converts human waste using bacteria and woodshavings into compost. Do not worry; this eco-toiletis odour-free as it has a good ventilation system.Biodegradable cleaning agents are used to keep thetoilet clean and hygienic too.Apart from being able to conserve water andconvert waste into fertiliser, this water-sensitiveurban design is also cheaper to build as comparedto a conventional toilet.</p>

<h3>Forest Trial</h3>
<h4><p>Walk along the 1km Forest Trail and you will feel adrop in your surrounding temperature as the trailbecomes shadier. Trees border the trail and lushcanopies stretch ahead. Several species of butterflieslike the Blue Pansy (Junonia orithya wallacei)and Common Grass Yellow (Eurema hecabecontubernalis) can be spotted here.</p></h4>

<h3>Fresh water habitat</h3>
<h4><p>Begin your journey at the shelter near the mainentrance of the park. Stretching for 1.2km, theDiversity Trail offers an easy walk with views ofdifferent flora and fauna along the way. Here, youwill find dense woods flanking both sides of the trailwith tall trees towering over you.Take a short walk down the unique, soft footpathcarpeted with Manila Grass (Zoysia matrella) untilyou find the viewing platform from which youcan get a good look at the freshwater pond. Atfirst sight, the pond seems to be devoid of life, butas you move forward to take a closer look, youwill be amazed by the sheer number of life formsliving in and around the pond. The ideal habitatfor dragonflies, the pond attracts species like theCommon Parasol (Neurothemis fluctuans) and theBlue Dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis).</p>

<h3>Snags Diversity Trail</h3>
<h4><p>Snags are standing dead trees that are situatedaway from footpaths and not removed from theirnatural environment. They serve as important nestsites for birds such as woodpeckers and are also afood source for many birds, as dead wood containsnumerous microorganisms.Snags also form an interesting landscape thatoffers a contrasting view from the rest of themanicured park greenery.</p>

<h3>Vegetated Swales and Water Catchment(Marsh Trail)</h3>
<h4><p>At more than 0.8km, Marsh Trail is the shortest trailin the park. Broad, shallow canals called vegetatedswales can be found here. These natural drains helpto channel excess surface runoff away from theground. A vegetated swale is dry during thedry season.The sides of the swale are gently sloped andfilled with plants and small stones. The gentleslope and plants slow down the speed of theflowing water. This helps reduce soil erosion. Theyalso serve as a natural form of filter before therainwater reaches the water catchment ponds.Spider Lily (Crinum asiaticum) and Mangrove Fern(Acrostichum speciosum) are examples of plantsused for this purpose.</p>
